						<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
			<p>Like most website operators, Cold Spaghetti collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Cold Spaghetti's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Cold Spaghetti's visitors use its website. From time to time, Cold Spaghetti may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
			<p>Cold Spaghetti also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://cole-wilson.github.io blog posts.
